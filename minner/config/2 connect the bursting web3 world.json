On September 26–27, FIL Singapore Summit will officially begin and what follows is Token2049. Zhou Guoping, a well-know writer, once claimed that human nature is vulgar, and his favorites are lively scenes and atmosphere. That, in my opinion, is not cheesy. It is full of humanity and vitality. When people see the rising sun, they feel warm deep down their hearts. We, human beings, have never stopped chasing wonderful things and a bright future. With high hopes for a more equitable and humane next-generation Internet, we run for it and shout out for it."

With enthusiasm and impetus, this is the norm of qualified Web3 practitioners who dare to think and dare to do. So we have “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”, the white paper of Ethereum, etc. coming out in 2008. The market cap across the industry has also increased from near zero in 2010 to more than a trillion dollars today. This disruptive decade has resulted in a valuable “treasure” that cannot be measured in monetary terms, which is formed by the great variety of Web 3 communities. They often have their own cultural identities, and value systems, and have the ability to broaden the voice and influence across the industry, which certainly should not be ignored. They are the early advocates of a project; as it evolves, they become essential players. They perform various roles at different phases to maximize the worth of individual community members and then compress it into a strong force of output."
